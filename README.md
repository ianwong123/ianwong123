# Hello (⌐□_□)

I'm Ian, a final year student based in the UK.

I like to design and create platforms and tools that aim to help users and developers.

If an interesting idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it.

I mainly work with Kubernetes, Docker, Go, Python, and Bash. I also incorporate CI/CD and observability tools into my projects if I feel like it.
